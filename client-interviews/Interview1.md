# First Interview with Client
## **If you could have it exactly how you want it, what would your website be able to do?**
"I want my website to be easy to navigate so that people don’t get confused while navigating it. 
I want the home bar to have 4 or 5 listed sections, **home, about, services, and contact definitely need to be there**, but finished samples might also be a good one to have. 
At one point, there used to be pictures that were correlated with the sections, I’d like to have that again. 
Before and after photos aren’t really something I’m interested in having on my website. 
I wouldn’t mind having some moving features of the website, like a moving slideshow, but I‘d also like for people to be able to stop on a certain image if they want to. 
Essentially, _**I want my website to be a portfolio of my work**_ to bring in more clients, but *please* don’t make it look too corporate. I’d like it to have a more artsy feel."

## **What do you like about your current website?**
"I like the color palette and feel of the website. I’d also like to keep my different socials at the bottom as well as the button to leave a google review."

## **What do you not like about your current site?**
"It’s too difficult to upload my new photos and the organization of the menu got all out of order and doesn’t look very presentable. 
Some of the pages have different organization, and I don’t like that very much. 
The margin I currently have could be removed or replaced, either by making the main content take up the whole space, or by changing it to a gradient."
