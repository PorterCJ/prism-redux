# prism-redux
### A fresh take on Prism Decorative Arts and Design's website to improve functionality and feel.
#### ***A personal project by Clayton Porter***


Goals are to explore, learn, and utilize JavaScript, Bootstrap, and React.js to remaster my mom's website.

Etiquette for the repository will be the same standard that I learned at CSU (with exception of having a teammate review my PRs) and the project will take the same phases of: 
**interview client, create user stories from the intrview, create a design, create epics and their subtasks, complete tasks to implement the epic, meet with client, and repeat where necessary**.

A note to myself:
*remember that this project is a learning experience and that mistakes will happen, just keep moving forward*
